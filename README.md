# CodeLauncher

As a web developer, you need to run many different processes for your development work. CodeLauncher provides a hub for all the server software you need, and you can organize them by project and check their output accordingly.

## Core Features

- Manage processes by project
- Check the output of each process
- Auto start projects when CodeLauncher starts
- Manage environment variables of each process
- Export/import projects for sharing between team members

## Open Source

If you have used supervisor on Linux before, you will find the concept is quite similar. CodeLauncher works like a GUI version of supervisor for macOS. You can also grab the source code and build it yourself if you want.
